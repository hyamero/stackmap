Ask your coding agent to diagram a codebase, a system, a process or a request. It writes a small typed JSON, stackmap validates it with repair hints the agent acts on, lays it out, and delivers one self-contained HTML viewer. No server, no account, nothing to install to open it.

Five kinds of diagram: **architecture** (components and what they call), **dataflow** (data moving through stages), **workflow** (steps across owner lanes), **lifecycle** (the states of one thing) and **sequence** (messages over time).

## Quick start

Install the skill into your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex and [others](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)):

```bash
npx skills add omsimos/stackmap
```

Then ask:

> Make an architecture diagram of this repository, backed by evidence from the code.

  </picture>
</p>

The agent writes `.stackmap/<name>/diagram.json`, validates and repairs it, and delivers `.stackmap/<name>/diagram.html`, opening it in your browser. It opens in any browser later too. To change the diagram, ask again: the agent edits the JSON and delivers it again. The viewer itself is read-only.

## The viewer

    <img alt="A tour of the viewer on the Commerce API diagram: zoom in and select Orders DB to see its connections and source evidence, open the Checkout path view, route from Storefront to Stripe, and play the flow hop by hop" src="assets/readme/tour.webp" width="100%">
  </picture>
</p>

- **Explore:** select a card to light its connections and dim the rest, with its details and source evidence in the inspector. **Trace** keeps a node's upstream and downstream; **Route** lights every path between two nodes.
- **Find:** search titles, ids and types; the **lens** dims the node types you don't need.
- **Guided views:** tabs the agent defines, like "Checkout path", that focus one part of the diagram. **Present** steps through them full screen.
- **Flow:** **Play** sends pulses along whatever you're looking at: the whole diagram, a view, a trace or a route, hop by hop.
- **Share:** the URL keeps the view, selection, route and playback. Export PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG, or a short video of the flow.
- **Keyboard:** `/` search, `R` route, `F` present, `P` play, `M` minimap, `Esc` clear; Tab and the arrow keys reach everything else.
- **Themes:** dark and light, and animations respect reduced motion.

## The diagram

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@omsimos/stackmap@0.4.0/dist/stackmap.schema.json",
  "kind": "architecture",
  "title": "Bookshop",
  "direction": "DOWN",
  "groups": [{ "id": "data", "label": "Data tier" }],
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "api", "type": "service", "card": { "title": "shop-api", "subtitle": "REST API" },
      "evidence": [{ "file": "services/api/src/server.ts", "line": 12 }] },
    { "id": "db", "type": "database", "group": "data", "card": { "title": "Orders DB", "subtitle": "PostgreSQL", "brand": "postgresql" } }
  ],
  "edges": [{ "id": "api-db", "from": "api", "to": "db" }],
  "views": [{ "id": "state", "label": "State", "nodes": ["db"] }]
}
```

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/card-dark.png">
    <img alt="A card's parts: the icon tile, up to three stats with a note, a footer with two items and a link; beside it, the six connection styles: a call, async, reply, main path, security crossing and failure path" src="assets/readme/card-light.png" width="100%">
  </picture>
</p>

- **Nodes:** nine types set the colour (`client`, `gateway`, `service`, `database`, `cache`, `queue`, `storage`, `external`, `security`), and lifecycles have seven state types. Cards can add rows, stats, a footer, a link and one of 146 [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) logos.
- **Edges** can be `async` or a `return`, with a `tone` for the main path, security crossings and failure paths.
- **No coordinates:** stackmap lays everything out, with [ELK](https://eclipse.dev/elk/) for architecture and dataflow and its own layout for lanes and sequences.

## The CLI

The skill runs the CLI for you, and it works on its own too (Node 22.12 or later):

```bash
npx @omsimos/stackmap validate diagram.json [--json]                # diagnostics with fixes; exit 1 on errors
npx @omsimos/stackmap deliver  diagram.json [-o out.html] [--open]  # validate → layout → one offline HTML file
npx @omsimos/stackmap serve    diagram.json [--port 4400]           # live viewer that reloads on every save
```

- **validate** lists every problem with a code, its evidence and the allowed fixes, including card text that won't fit. It exits `1` when the diagram has errors and `2` on usage, IO or internal errors.
- **deliver** is deterministic: the same JSON always gives the same file, byte for byte.
- **serve** binds `127.0.0.1` only, keeps the last good version on screen when a save is invalid, and keeps your camera and selection across reloads.

## Development

Bun workspaces monorepo; tests run on Node via Vitest and Playwright.

```bash
bun install
bun run test && bun run typecheck && bun run build   # unit tests, types, viewer template + CLI bundle
```

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the packages, the e2e and visual regression tests, branches, commit messages and how releases work. The mark, lockups, icons and social card are in [`assets/brand/`](assets/brand/), with the rules for using them.

stackmap is a successor to [archify](https://github.com/tt-a1i/archify) by tt-a1i, itself based on [Cocoon AI's architecture-diagram-generator](https://github.com/Cocoon-AI/architecture-diagram-generator). It keeps archify's agent → JSON → validate → single-HTML model and its repair loop, with a new renderer and visual language.
